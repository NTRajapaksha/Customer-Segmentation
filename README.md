# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project utilizes K-Means Clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant features.
The resulting clusters are implemented as a new column in the dataset, which is then saved as an updated dataset.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

## ðŸŒŸ Features

Customer Segmentation: Implementation of K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer segments.

Elbow Method: Calculation of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method, which involves plotting the within-cluster squared sum of errors (WCSS) against a range of cluster numbers to identify the optimal point.

Dataset Enhancement: The clusters are added as a new column in the dataset, which is resaved as a new file for further analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The project aims to enable businesses to better understand their customer base by categorizing them into segments, facilitating more effective and personalized marketing strategies.
